# My toolkit

## How to run Rust code:

First of all, please make sure you have Rust downloaded:

    - rustc
    - cargo
    - rustup

Please, visit: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install

## How do you run the code?

### Using `Cargo`

This is the straightforward approach:

```
cargo run
```

It will run the code as long as they are valid syntax. On my machine, at 22:50 on the 6th of June in 2025, it successfully ran. I used the latest Rust version, which is

```
rustup -V
```

Showed:


```
rustc 1.86.0 (05f9846f8 2025-03-31)
```

Because I did not have any tests - it is not any app. It is just code for you to run them if you are not sure, and for me to expand on later, as I grow with Rust. 

## Rust-inspired code:

> It is not finished. However, it does contain the code I showcased here:

You can download the package (Python): [here](https://test.pypi.org/project/tomodachi/)

### Code

```py
from functools import cached_property
from tomodachi_core.common_types.result import Result, Ok, Err, result_wrapper
import pandas as pd


class Service:
    def __init__(self, path: str) -> None:
        if not isinstance(path, str):
            raise ValueError("Please, provide valid path!")
        
        self.path = path


    def load_csv_data(self) -> Result[pd.DataFrame, str]:
        try:
            df = pd.read_csv(self.path)

            self.df = (
                Ok(df)
                .and_then(self.remove_unnamed_and_convert_dates)
                .and_then(self.remove_millimeters)
                .unwrap()
            )

            return Ok(self.df)
        except (
            FileNotFoundError, 
            pd.errors.ParserError,
              pd.errors.EmptyDataError, 
              Exception
              ) as e:
            return Err(e)
```

which then helps us

```py
class PandasService(Service):
    def __init__(self, path: str = "") -> None:
        super().__init__(path)
        self.preprocessor = PreprocessData()
        

    @override
    def load_csv_data(self):
        match super().load_csv_data():
            case Ok(value=df) if isinstance(df, pd.DataFrame):
                return df
            case Err(error=error):
                return Err(error=error)
```

### 🦀 Why Python code here looks like Rust

I’m experimenting with applying Rust’s functional programming idioms (fold, map, filter, and explicit Result types) in Python to make my data handling more robust and readable. This helps me practice cross-language thinking and learn Rust concepts deeply. Feel free to check your own Rust repo to see how similar patterns can apply!

> Take a look at Rust open source: Some (Option<T> - located in [here](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/library/core/src/option.rs)) got so many useful functionalities. I cannot ignore that!
